# QR Code Generator

A simple tool to generate QR codes from URLs.

## How It Works

1. Paste the URL you want to convert into a QR code in the `URL.txt` file.
2. Run `index.js` to generate the QR code.
3. The QR code will be saved as `qr_img.png`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd qr-code-generator
   ```
3. Paste the URL in `URL.txt`.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
5. Check the generated QR code in `qr_img.png`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Web Interface**: A web-based interface is planned where you can paste a URL and generate a QR code directly on the platform.
